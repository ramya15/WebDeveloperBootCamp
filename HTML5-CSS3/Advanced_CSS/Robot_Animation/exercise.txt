Exercise: Robot Animation Starter Files

It's time to create your new robot friend. 
But he needs some assembly first! 
Using everything you learned in this section, and your best friend: 
Google Developer Tools in the browser, try to assemble your new robot friend. 

Once you are done, customize your robot, and add any animation you want. 
Then, you can submit it to our Discord in the #css channel for myself and others to view! 
You can send your CSS and HTML5 files or screen capture your robot. 

Good luck!
