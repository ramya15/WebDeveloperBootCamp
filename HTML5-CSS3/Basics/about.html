            Lorem ipsum began as scrambled, nonsensical Latin derived from Cicero's 1st-century BC text De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum.

        <p class="text">
            Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like
            it, and it actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious reader, “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate
            the frequency with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.”
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”, looks like Latin
            because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin. McClintock's eye for detail certainly helped narrow the whereabouts
            of lorem ipsum's origin, however, the “how and when” still remain something of a mystery, with competing theories
            and timelines.

            Lorem ipsum was purposefully designed to have no meaning, but appear like real text, making it the perfect placeholder. Lorem
            ipsum was popularized in the 1960s with Letraset's dry-transfer sheets, and later entered the digital world via
            Aldus PageMaker. Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering
            the source behind the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by consectetur—a
            genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum
            et Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.

            Some claim lorem ipsum threatens to promote design over content, while others defend its value in the process of planning.
            Generally, lorem ipsum is best suited to keeping templates from looking bare or minimizing the distractions of
            draft copy. Coming full circle, the internet's remixing of the now infamous lorem ipsum passage has officially
            elevated it to pop culture status.
